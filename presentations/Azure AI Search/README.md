# Mastering Intelligent Search with Azure AI Search

Enterprise data is growing faster than ever, but 80% remains unstructured and unsearchable. What if your users could find any document, image, or piece of information using plain English - even across terabytes of data?"

Azure AI Search is a cloud service from Microsoft that allows you to search structured and unstructured data and documents by content, metadata, keywords, image information, and other properties. Using AI Search, users can submit their search criteria utilizing a natural language, such as English.

In this session, you will learn how to configure this service to index documents and enable powerful querying of your data. You will see how organizations reduce information retrieval time from hours to seconds, improve customer service response rates, and unlock hidden insights from decades of archived content. This session is essential for data architects, search engineers, and technical leaders building intelligent applications that need to surface relevant information instantly
