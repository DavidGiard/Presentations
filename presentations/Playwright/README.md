# Automating User Interface Tests with Playwright

## Abstract

Testing a user interface is an important part of the development life cycle. However this testing is often done manually, which is expensive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent. Automating this process can make UI testing far more effective and efficient.

Azure Playwright is an open source node.js project that provides a way to automate user interface testing.
