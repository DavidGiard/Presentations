# Automating User Interface Tests with Playwright

Testing a user interface is an important part of the development life cycle. However this testing is often done manually, which is expensive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent.

Azure Playwright is an open source node.js project that provides a way to automate user interface testing.

In this presentation, you will learn:

- how to create automated UI tests via code or screeen recording
- how to run UI tests locally and in the cloud
- how to incorporate UI tests into your CI/CD pipelines
